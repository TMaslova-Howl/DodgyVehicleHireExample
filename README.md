# DodgyVehicleHireExample

This is an example of an API for imaginary slightly dodgy car hiring company to demonstrate the use of Spock
testing framework for unit tests.
This example uses in memory database and even a very hacky hardcoded AdminFees class that pretends to be a repository
for the time saving porpoises.
This example also contains a brief API tests that are written in Spock and JUnit.
